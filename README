Here is the source to adrt/isst.  You'll need to separately compile adrt
and isst in their respective directories doing the standard "autoreconf
-vis && ./configure && make clean && make".  adrt_master and adrt_slave
are used to establish compute nodes and isst is the client that attaches
to the master.  There is a MySQL database that must exist (described in
the README) that contains BRL-CAD Geometry.  There is a utility within
the ISST folder that is used for transforming a BRL-CAD geometry file
containing BOTS (along with a region map file) into an entry in the
MySQL database such that ISST can generate a list of available targets.
Check the MySQL database for isst running on either orthus or shiva for
a working example.  Hope this helps,
